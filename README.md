# ClimateDecomposer

ClimateDecomposer is a streamlit app built on python code that allows you to decompose famous paleoclimate records into their constituent periodic components. In other words, it lets you visualise the different cyclic components of past climates using *Singular Spectrum Analysis* (SSA). 

You can view the deployed app [here](https://aidanstarr-climatedecomposer-app-jlvvxe.streamlit.app/).

Created and maintained by [Aidan Starr](https://aidanstarr.github.io/). SSA code adapted from [Braun et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-023-00717-5) and [this blog post by Jordon D\'Arcy](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jdarcy/introducing-ssa-for-time-series-decomposition/notebook). The app itself is inspired by [**Renewcast** by Giannis Tolios](http://renewcast.giannis.io/) - check it out.  

A primer on SSA for paleoclimate time series can be found [in this paper by Vautard and Ghil](https://doi.org/10.1016/0167-2789(89)90077-8). For now, try different window sizes (L) using the slider on the left, and see what the different Reconstructed Components are like!
